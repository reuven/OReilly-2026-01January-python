    "- `input`\n",
    "- `len`\n",
    "- `type`\n",
    "- `sum`\n",

    "Do we need to write our own functions? No! We can have a perfectly reasonable program without writing any new functions ourselves.\n",

    "- If we have the same code in several places in our program, we can/should replace those with a function.\n",

    "The idea is that instead of having the same code in many places, we'll have it in a single place, and just refer to it each time. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The idea of abstraction is that we put a name on many small things, and then treat it as one big thing. By doing this, we ignore the lower-level details, and can think at a higher level -- and thus solve higher-level, bigger problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction allows us to solve a problem, package it up, give it a name, and then deal with it as a single entity. Functions do this for collections of actions. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we define a function, we are not adding new functionality to Python. But we are making it easier to read, write, and debug/maintain our program."
