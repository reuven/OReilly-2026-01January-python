    "\n",
    "We've talked about DRY -- don't repeat yourself! -- numerous times during the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of DRY:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the same code is repeated, several lines in a row... you can use a `for` loop.\n",
    "2. If the same code is repeated, several times in your program ... you can use a function.\n",
    "3. If the same code is repeated, across several different programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution that programmers have used for many years is a *library*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's version of libraries is known as \"modules.\" Actually, there are modules and there are packages. You can think of a module as a file (because it is one!) and of a package as a folder containing multiple files (because it is one!).\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If someone has written a package/module with code that we want to use, we can ask Python to load it for us, and then we don't have to write that code ourselves.\n",
    "- If we have written code for one program that'll be useful in others, we can publish it as a module/package, and then we can use it in those other programs.\n",
    "- If we have written code that others might find useful, we can publish it and share it with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules in Python are also *namespaces*. That is, they help to separate variables that different people have defined in different programs. You can think of namespaces as \"last names\" for variables/functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A module contains variables (data structures), functions, and even new data types (\"classes\"). When you load a module into memory, you're getting the variables, functions, and classes that someone else has defined. This means you don't have to do that work yourself! You can take advantage of what they've done."

    "\n",
    "1. `import` is *not* a function. So we don't use `()` with it.\n",
    "2. `import` does not take a string or a filename as its argument. Rather, the name put next to `import` is the module name we want to load (i.e., the variable we'll want to define) and *also* the name of the file on disk that we want to load, more or less.\n",
    "3. After you have run `import` on a module, assuming it works, you have access to all of the data structures and functions and classes defined in that module.\n",
    "4. Those names are all available after the module name and a `.`. Everything in the `random` module will be available as `random.THING`. That can be data or a function."
