    "We've talked about DRY -- don't repeat yourself! -- numerous times during the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of DRY:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the same code is repeated, several lines in a row... you can use a `for` loop.\n",
    "2. If the same code is repeated, several times in your program ... you can use a function.\n",
    "3. If the same code is repeated, across several different programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution that programmers have used for many years is a *library*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's version of libraries is known as \"modules.\" Actually, there are modules and there are packages. You can think of a module as a file (because it is one!) and of a package as a folder containing multiple files (because it is one!).\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If someone has written a package/module with code that we want to use, we can ask Python to load it for us, and then we don't have to write that code ourselves.\n",
    "- If we have written code for one program that'll be useful in others, we can publish it as a module/package, and then we can use it in those other programs.\n",
    "- If we have written code that others might find useful, we can publish it and share it with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules in Python are also *namespaces*. That is, they help to separate variables that different people have defined in different programs. You can think of namespaces as \"last names\" for variables/functions."
